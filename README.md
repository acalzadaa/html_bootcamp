# HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT BOOTCAMP

This project is intented to explore the massive world of HTML5 and CSS. The goal of this training is to be proficient with HTML5 and CSS. Because the breath of information regarding this topic is overwelming, I'll be using the book "New Perspectives HTML5 and CSS3" as a guide. This book was a utter failure because it doesn't have access to the source code, making it difficult to follow the exercises.

I'll be using HTML5 and CSS3 2nd Ed. from Hogan, Brian P. The Pragmatic Programmers.
